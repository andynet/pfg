    \caption{
        Comparison of running times of pangenomic graph construction tools.
        Wall clock times are measured by the built-in bash command \texttt{time} and rounded up to the nearest second.
        In addition to the measured times, \texttt{pggb} and \texttt{vg} need preprocessing of the pangenome.
        \texttt{pggb} requires the fasta file to be indexed.
        \texttt{vg} builds a pangenome from a VCF file or a multiple sequence alignment.
