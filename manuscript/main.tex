%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Recently, many graph structures for computational pangenomics were proposed.
  In order to be useful, these graph structures need to implement several
  operations such as efficient construction from many complete genomes,
  mapping of short and long read.
  These basic bioinformatics operations are well studied on sequential data,
  and together with data structures such as suffix trees, suffix arrays and 
  burrows wheeler transform allow high performance.
  Attempts to implement these operations on graphs brings with it many complications
  since these date structures are not easily obtainable for graphs.
  In this work, we introduce prefix-free graphs, a pangenomic data structure
  allowing to obtain the well known data structures from stringology in graph
  settings, which in turn allows for many efficient operations on pangenomes.
