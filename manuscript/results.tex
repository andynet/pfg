\section{Results}
We implemented the prefix-free graphs package in rust programming language.
There are two binary crates and one library crate included in the package.
Binary crates serve the purpose of creating prefix-free graphs from FASTA and from GFA formats.
Library crate provides an interface for working with the prefix-free graphs,
mainly an iterator of suffix array in sublinear space and linear time.

The binary crates are fasta2pfg and gfa2pfg with usage:
\begin{minted}{bash}
fasta2pfg -t triggers.txt < pangenome.fna > pfg.gfa

gfa2pfg -t triggers.txt < pangenome.gfa > pfg.gfa
\end{minted}

The library can be used from within rust programming language as follows:

\begin{minted}{rust}
let pfg = PFG::load("pfg.gfa");

for (i, sa_i) in pfg.iter().enumerate() {
    println!("{}\t{}", i, sa_i);
}
\end{minted}

We compared the pangenome construction of several tools.
