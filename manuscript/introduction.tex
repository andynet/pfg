\section{Introduction}
Suffix array is a data structure used in many fields, such as stringology,
bioinformatics, and... .
Particularly in bioinformatics, it is used as part of FM index, which in turn
is used for read mapping.
Recently, a new paradigm in bioinformatics was formed, moving from a single
reference genome to a pangenome.
The term pangenome was first used by \citet{tettelin2005genome} in 2005 during the
resequencing experiments on streptococcus.
Since then, the definition of a pangenome has shifted to any set of sequences
analysed jointly \cite{computational2018computational}.
Nevertheless, most pangenomes consist of highly related sequences and thus are
highly repetitive.
This leads to representation of pangenomes as graphs, where similar genome
regions are represented by a single node and the nodes are conected to paths
representing the original sequences.
Several approaches of pangenomic graph construction exist, such as variation
graphs \cite{church2015extending}?, cactus graphs \cite{paten2011cactus}, 
Wheeler graphs \cite{gagie2017wheeler} ...
Most of these approaches require an initial local alignment of similar regions,
which makes them computationally expensive.
Here we present a new class of graphs, prefix-free graphs, which are easy to
construct and provide a way how to efficiently index them to allow pattern 
search queries.

Prefix-free graphs play an important role in improving space
complexity of several efficient algorithms, but are never the concept is never
framed as a pangenomic data structure.
We think that separating and clearly defining this data structure can lead to
more advancements...
Our contribution is in defining a data structure called prefix-free graphs and
showing how this data structure can be used to generate suffix array in
sublinear space.
Furthermore, we implemented two binaries for an easy construction of prefix-free
graphs from a set of sequences, and from a graph in gfa format.
Furthermore, we implemented rust library for working with prefix-free graphs.
This library contains an iterator, which can be directly used to generate the 
suffix array in sublinear space.
